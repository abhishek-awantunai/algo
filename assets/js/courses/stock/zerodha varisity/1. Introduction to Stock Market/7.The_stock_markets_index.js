                                The Stock Markets Index

7.1 - Overview :-
    - Stock markets do have listed 1000's of companies and if we want to check how market is doing then we can't just check how all of these companies are doing. We just check few important companies across key industrial sectors to get the idea of the stock market.  

7.2 - The Index :-
    - Just stated above ki pure market ka idea lagane ke liye hume saare companies ke share ke price flucturation ke jan ne ki jarurat nahi hai hume to bas har sector ke kuch top companies ke bare me jankari honi chahiye jis se ki hume stock market kaisa chal rha uska mota moti idea lag jaye.
    - Luckily hume khud se har sector ke companies ko track kr ke unko track krne ki jarurat nai padti kyoki stock market already hume " Market Index " provide krta hai.
    - Mainly india me 2 market index hai :-
        - SENSEX :- S&P BSE ( BOMBAY STOCK EXCHANGE ke market ka mota moti idea lene ke liye )
            - S&P ( Standard and Poor’s ) ek global credit rating agency hai jo ye index nikal ne me expert hai. 
            - S&P ke pas technical expertise hai jis se wo index nikalta hai aur fir isne BSE ko licensed de rkha hai is sart pe ki bhai mera nam bhi sath me lga liyo index me taki hume bhi to faayda ho thora. Isiliye is index ke sath ye S&P tag juda hai. 
        - NIFTY :- CNS NSE ( NATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE ke market ka mota moti idea lene ke liye )
            - India Index Services & Products Limited (IISL) jo ki National Stock Exchange and CRISIL dono ka mila hua joint venture hai jo ki ye index nikalti hai isiliye CNX tag jodte hai  ( CRISIL & NSE )
    - Index se hume minute by minute idea lagta hai ki market kaisa perform kr rha hai.Jab index upar jata hai matlb majority of market participant ko lagta hai future will be better aur jab neeche jata hai to participants perceive the future pessimistically.. 

7.3 - Practical uses of the Index :-
    - Information :-
        - Index market ka trend dikhata hai for a period of time.
        - Index mote taur pe country ki economy kis direction me move kr rhi hai reflect krta hai.   
    - Benchmarking :-
        - Genrally agar hum koi investment karte hai to at the end of the year we can check ki either if we made money or lost money in %.And in order to compare we can check how Nifty moved in that time frame and we can check if we underperformed or performed excellently.
    - Trading :-
        - Majority of log index pe hi trade krte hai. 
        - They take a broader call on the economy or general state of aﬀairs, and translate that into a trade.
        - Index trading is possible through the derivative markets.
    - Portfolio Hedging :-
        - Genrally investors diversify karte hai apne stocks long term goals ke liye but kabhi kabhi market buri tarike se crash ho jata hai like in 2008 so kafi investors safe khelne ke liye index pe hi paisa lga dete hai.

7.4 - Index construction methodology :-
    - Index calculate hone ke liye certain companies ko choose kiya jata hai aur fir unko track kiya jata hai.Ab ye list of companies dynamic hoti hai.Index banani wali company kuch criteria rkhti hai jiske basis pe koi bhi company andar bahar hote rehti hai is list se.
    - Har company ka weightage hota hai ki ye kitna effect dalti hai total index pe.Like ITC had 7.6% weightage on Nifty 50 in 2k14.
    - Ab question uth ta hai ki ye weightage kaise define krte hai.
    - Weightage hum  kisi company ka free floating market capitalization ke basis pe descide krte hai.
    - FREE FLOATING MARKET CAPITALIZATION = 
        - ( total number of outstanding shares in market * price of each share )

7.5 - Sector specific indices :-
    - Jaise NIFTY and SENSEX NSE and BSE ke market ka haal chaal batate hai usi tarah sector specific indices bhi hote hai.Jo us specific sector ke market ke baare me idea dete hai.
    - For example the Bank Nifty on NSE represents the mood specific to the banking industry. The CNX IT on NSE represents the behavior of all the IT stocks in the stock markets
