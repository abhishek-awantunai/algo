                Key Events and Their Impact on Markets

- 12.1 - Overview :-
    - Bas kisi company ko dekh kr stock le lena is not a good idea.
    - Future Events ko bhi dhyan me rkhna chahiye jis se market impact ho skta hai.
    
- 12.2 - Monetary Policy :-
    - Har country ki ek central bank hoti hai usi tarah india ki central bank RBI hai.
    - Har country ki central bank responsible hoti hai interest rates ko set krne ke liye.
    - RBI money supply ko contol krta hai interest rate ko tweak kr ke using MONETRY POLICY
    - RBI has to strike a balance between growth and inflation. 
    - Is policy ka use krke RBI growth aur inflation ke bich perfect balance establish kr ke indian economy ko balance krna hai.
    - Maan lo agar interest rates jyada ho gya to koi bhi coorporate is badhe interest rate pe udhar lena nahi chahega aur unka growth slow ho jayega aur agar coorporates hi slow ho gye to pura economy slow ho jayega.
    - Iska ulta maan lo agar interest rates kam ho jaye matlb.Consumers and Coorporates easily paisa udhar le lenge aur is extra money ke sath anap shanap kharch karege aur chizo ki demand badhegi aur seller iska faayda utha kr price badhaega and this will lead to inflation.
    - Isi ko balance krne ke liye RBI monetary policy ke through kuch key rates ko set krta hai :-
        a.) Repo rate :-
            - Ye wo rate hai jis rate pe RBI kisi aur bank ko karja deta hai.Iske badhne ka matlab hai ki cost of borrowing badh gya hai so slow growth hone wali hai economy me.Markets don't like increasing repo rates.
        b.) Reverse repo rate :-
            -  Ye wo rate hai jis rate pe RBI kisi aur bank se karja leti hai.Agar bank RBI ko paise deta hai matlb wo market se paisa utha kr RBI ko pailse de rha hai ar is se market me supply of money thora kam ho jata hai.
            - Increase in RRR is also not good for economy.
        c.) Cash reserve ratio (CRR) :-
            - Every bank is mandatorily required to maintain funds with RBI. The amount that they maintain is dependent on the CRR. If CRR increases then more money is removed from the system, which is again not good for the economy.

        The RBI meets every quarter to review the rates. This is a key event that the market watches out for. The first to react to rate decisions would be interest rate sensitive stocks across various sectors such as – banks, automobile, housing finance, real estate, metals etc.


- 12.3 - Inflation :-
    - Increasing inflation erodes the purchasing power of money
    - There are two types of inflation indices – 
        - a.) Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
            - The WPI indicates the movement in prices at the wholesale level.
            - It captures the price increase or decrease when they are sold between organizations.Matlb pura stock ko jab koi delaler leta hai. 


        - b.) Consumer Price Index (CPI) -
            - Hum yani retailers jab koi saaman kharidte hai to usme kitni paise ki badhotri hoti hai. Calculation of CPI is quite detailed as it involves classifying consumption into various categories and sub categories across urban and rural regions. Each of these categories is made into an index. This means the final CPI index is a composition of several internal indices.
            - It is one of the most critical metrics for studying the economy.
            - Ministry of Statistics and Programme implementation (MOSPI) publishes the CPI numbers around the 2nd week of every month.
            - The RBI’s challenge is to strike a balance between inflation and interest rates. Usually a low interest rate tends to increase the inflation and a high interest rate tends to arrest the inflation

- 12.4 - Index of Industrial Production (IIP) :-
    - It is a short term indicator of how the industrial sector in the country is progressing.
    - Data is released every month (along with inflation data) by Ministry of Statistics and Programme implementation (MOSPI).
    - If the IIP is increasing it indicates a vibrant industrial environment (as the production is going up) and hence a positive sign for the economy and markets. A decreasing IIP indicates a sluggish production environment, hence a negative sign for the economy and markets.
    - A lower IIP number puts pressure on the RBI to lower the interest rates.

- 12.5 - Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) :-
    - Pure desh me business activity kya chal rha hai uska ek genric index.
    - It indicate their change in business perception with respect to the previous month.
    - It include factors such as new orders, output, business expectations and employment amongst others.
    - The PMI number usually oscillates around 50. A reading above 50 indicates expansion and below 50 indicates a contraction in the economy. And a reading at 50 indicates no change in the economy.

- 12.6 - Budget :-
    - The Budget is an event during which the Ministry of Finance discusses the country’s finance in detail.
    - Budget plays a very important role in the economy. 
    - Budget is an annual event and it is announced during the last week of February
    
    - To illustrate this further, one of the expectations for the budget (July 2014) was to increase the duties on cigarette. As expected, during the budget, the Finance Minister raised the duties on cigarette, and hence the prices of cigarettes were also increased. An increased cigarette price has a few implications:
        - 1. Increased cigarette prices discourage smokers from buying cigarettes (needless to say this is a debatable) and hence the profitability of the cigarette manufacturing companies such as ITC decreases. If the profitability decreases then investors may want to sell shares of ITC.
        - 2. If market participants start selling ITC, then the markets will come down because ITC is an index heavy weight.
        - In fact as a reaction to the budget announcement ITC traded 3.5% lower for this precise reason.

- 12.7 - Corporate Earnings Announcement
    - One of the important events to which the stocks react
    - Every company listed on stock exchange declare their earning numbers once in every quarter, also called the quarterly earning numbers. Like :-
        - How much revenue the company has generated?
        - How has the company managed its expense?
        - How much money the company paid in terms of taxes and interest charges?
        - What is the profitability during the quarter?
    - Besides some companies give an overview of what they expect from the upcoming quarters. This forecast is called the ‘corporate guidance’.
    

- Markets and individual stocks react to events. Market participants should equip themselves
to understand and decipher these events
- Monetary policy is one of the most important economic event. During the monetary policy,
review actions on repo, reverse repo, CRR etc are initiated
- Interest rates and inflation are related. Increasing interest rates curbs inflation and vice versa
- Inflation data is released every month by MOSPI. As a consumer, CPI inflation data is what
you need to track
- IIP measures the industrial production activity. Increase in IIP cheers the markets and lower IIP disappoints the market
- PMI is a survey based business sentiment indicator. The PMI number oscillates around the 50 mark. Above 50 is good news to markets and PMI below 50 is not.
- The Budget is an important market event where policy announcements and reform initiatives
are taken. Markets and stocks react strongly to budget announcements
- Corporate earnings are reported every quarter. Stocks react mainly due to the variance in
actual number versus the street’s expectation.
