        - Market Order :- 
            - when you intend to buy at market available prices instead of a very specific price that you have in mind.
            - This means when you place a market order, you will never be sure of the price at which you would transact, and this could be quite a dangerous situation if you are an active trader. 
        - A stop loss order :- 
            - A stop loss order is a passive order. In order to activate it, we need to enter a trigger price. A trigger price, usually above the stop loss price acts as a price threshold and only after crossing this price the stop loss order transitions from a passive order to an active order.
