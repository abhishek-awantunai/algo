                                Clearing and Settlement


- 10.1 - Overview :- 

- 10.2 - What happens when you buy a stock? :-
    - Day 1 – The trade (T Day), Monday :-
        - The day you make the transaction is referred to as the trade date, represented as ‘T Day’.
        - Suppose if we want to buy 100 shares of relince which is 1000/ per share.
        - So a total amount of 1000*100 = 100000 i.e lac + 26.32 ( which includes all the applicable charges) = Rs.100,126.32/- will be deducted from our trading account.
        - Broker generates a ‘contract note’ and sends you a copy of the same.
            - Contract Note : - 
                - It is like a bill generated detailing every transaction your made
                - It also shows the breakup of charges charged by the broker.

    - Day 2 – Trade Day + 1 (T+ day, Tuesday) :-
        - The day after you made the transaction is called the T+1 day
        - On T+1 day you can sell the stock that you purchased the previous day. If you do so, you are basically doing a quick trade called “Buy Today, Sell Tomorrow” (BTST) or “Acquire Today, Sell Tomorrow” (ATST).
        - Risk involved in BTST so try to avoid it.
    
    - Day 3 – Trade Day + 2 (T+2 day, Wednesday) :-
        - On day 3 or the T+2 day, around 11 AM shares are debited from the person who sold you the shares and credited to the brokerage with whom you are trading, who will in turn credit it to your DEMAT account by end of day. Similarly money which was debited from you is credited to the person who sold the shares.


    - So for all practical purposes if you buy a share on day T Day, you can expect to receive the shares in your DEMAT account only by end of T+2 day. The shares are available for transaction on T+3day.
