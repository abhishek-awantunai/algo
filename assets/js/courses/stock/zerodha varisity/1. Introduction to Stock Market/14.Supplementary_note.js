- IPO :- ( Initial Public Offering )
    - Jab koi company pehli baar public se paise uthati hai to use IPO ( initial public offering ) kehte hai.
    - IPO ke jariye uthaya gya paise sidhe company ke pas jata hai.
    - IPO ke jariye jo company stock exchange pe listen nahi hai wo bhi stock exchange pe listed ho jati hai.
    - Jo company apna IPO lati hai wo apni company ka DRHP ( Draft Red Hearing Prospectus ) publish karti hai jisme ki us company ka pura business flow and details ke baare me pata chalya hai.
    
    
- OFS :- ( Offer For Sale )
    - Isme jo company stock exchange pe listed hai uske promoters apna share bhech sakte hai.
    - In short isme promoters apna share bechte hai aur iske badle me jo paise wo public se uthate hai wo sidha us promoter ko jata hai.
    - Isme promoter ki ownership public ko transfer ki jati hai.
    - Started in 2012
    - Only top 200 companies ( as per market capitalization ) promoters can offer there share for sale.
    - According to rule kisi bhi stock exchange me listed company me atleast 25% public share hona chahiye.
    - So is minimum rule ko follow krke ke liye promoters apna share bech te hai.


- FPO :- ( Follow on Public Offer )
    - Jab koi company pehli baar public se paise uthati hai to use IPO kehte hai but jab wo stock market me list hone ke baad dubara paise uthati hai to use FPO bolte hai.  


- Right Issue :- 
    - Isme naye share company ke existing shareholders ko discount pe diya jata hai 


- Both in IPO and FPO new fresh shares are offered to public hence takes time.
- Offer for sale is fast.
