                            Single Candlestick patterns (Part 2)

- The Spinning Top :-
    - Spinning tops are indicative of a market where indecision and uncertainty prevails
    - Bulls made a futile attempt to take the market higher. The bears tried to take the markets lower and it did not work either. Neither the bulls nor the bears were able to establish any influence on the market as this is evident with the small real body
    - It just conveys indecision as both bulls and bears were not able to influence the market.
    - With the spinning top in the down trend the bears could be consolidating their position before resuming another bout of selling. Also, the bulls have attempted to arrest the price fall and have tried to hold on to their position, though not successfully.
        - Either there will be another round of selling
        - Or the markets could reverse its directions and the prices could increase
    - If the trader has been waiting for an opportunity to go long on the stock, probably this could be his opportunity to do so. However to play safe he could test the waters with only half the quantity. If the trader wants to buy 500 shares, he could probably enter the trade with 250 shares and could wait and watch the market. If the market reverses its direction, and the prices indeed start going up then the trader can average up by buying again. If the prices reverse; most likely the trader would have bought the stocks at the lowest prices. 

    - Think about the spinning top as “The calm before the storm”.
        - The storm could be in the form of a continuation or a reversal of the trend. In which way the price will eventually move is not certain, however what is certain is the movement itself. One needs to be prepared for both the situations.

- The Dojis :- 
    - The next time you see either a Spinning top or a Doji individually or in a cluster, remember there is indecision is the market. The market could swing either ways and you need to build a stance that adapts to the expected movement in the market.
