    - Concept of technical analysis will remain the same irrespective of the asset you are studying.
    - Indicator such as ‘Moving average convergence divergence’ (MACD) or ‘Relative strength index’ (RSI) is used exactly the same way on equity, commodity or currency

- 2.3 – Assumption in Technical Analysis :-
    - Technical Analysts don’t care whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued. In fact the thing that matters is the stocks past trading data (price and volume) and what information this data can provide about the future movement in the security.

    - Technical Analysis is based on few key assumptions :-
        - 1) Markets discount everything :- 
            - All known and unknown information in the public domain is reflected in the latest stock price.Matlb agar koi insider trading bhi kar rha hoga to techical analysis me pta chal jayega.For example there could be an insider in the company buying the company’s stock in large quantity in anticipation of a good quarterly earnings announcement. While he does this secretively, the price reacts to his actions thus revealing to the technical analyst that this could be a good buy 

        - 2) The ‘how’ is more important than ‘why’ :-
            - The technical analyst would not be interested in questioning why the insider bought the stock as long he knows how the price reacted to the insider’s action.

        - 3) Price moves in trend :-
            - Once the trend is established, the price moves in the direction of the trend.
            - All major moves in the market is an outcome of a trend
                   
        - 4) History tends to repeat itself :-
            - The price trend tends to repeat itself.
            - In up trending markets, market participants get greedy and want to buy irrespective of the high price.Likewise in a down trend, market participants want to sell irrespective of the low and unattractive prices.
