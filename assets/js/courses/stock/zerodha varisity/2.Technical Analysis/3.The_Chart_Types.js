                                    The Chart Types

- 3.1– Overview :- 
    - Having recognized that the Open (O), high (H), low (L), and close (C) serves as the best way to summarize the trading action for the given time period, we need a charting technique that displays this information in the most comprehensible way.
    - The regular charts that we are generally used to – like the column chart, pie chart, area chart etc does not work for technical analysis.
    - The regular charts don’t work mainly because they display one data point at a given point in time. However Technical Analysis requires four data points to be displayed at the same time.
    - Some of the chart types :-
        - Bar Chart
        - Line chart
        - Japanese Candlestick

- 3.2 – The Line and Bar chart :-
    - Line chart is the most basic chart type and it uses only one data point to form the chart. When it comes to technical analysis, a line chart is formed by plotting the closing prices of a stock or an index. A dot is placed for each closing price and the various dots are then connected by a line.


- 3.4 – Candlestick Anatomy :-
    - Note, a long bodied candle depicts strong buying or selling activity. A short bodied candle depicts less trading activity and hence less price movement.
