                                        Getting Started with Candlesticks


- 4.1 – History tends to repeat itself – The big assumption :-
    - History tends to repeat itself. And this is what candlestick patterns depends on.
    - History tends to repeat itself. However we need to make an addendum to this assumption. When a set of factors that has panned out in the past tends to repeat itself in the future, we expect the same outcome to occur, as was observed in the past, provided the factors are the same. As long as factors remain same.
  
- 4.2 – Candlestick patterns and what to expect :-
    - The patterns are formed by grouping two or more candles in a certain sequence. However, sometimes powerful trading signals can be identified by just single candlestick pattern.
    
- 4.3 – Few assumptions specific to candlesticks :- 
    - Buy strength and sell weakness :- 
        - Strength is represented by a bullish (blue) candle and weakness by a bearish (red) candle. Hence whenever you are buying ensure it is a blue candle day and whenever you are selling, ensure it’s a red candle day.
    - Be flexible with patterns (quantify and verify) :- 
        - Jaruri nahi ki sab kuch candlestick pattern ke according hi ho maybe kabhi kuch factors different ho to us case me maybe ho skta hai.So you have to be flexible.
    - Look for a prior trend :- 
        - If you are looking at a bullish pattern, the prior trend should be bearish and likewise if you are looking for a bearish pattern, the prior trend should be bullish.
