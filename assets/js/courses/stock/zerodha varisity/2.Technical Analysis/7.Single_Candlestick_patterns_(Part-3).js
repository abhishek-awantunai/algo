- Paper Umbrella :-
    
    - Please note once you initiate the trade you stay in it until either the stop loss or the target is reached. You should not tweak the trade until one of these events occurs. The loss in this particular trade (first hammer) is inevitable. But remember this is a calculated risk and not a mere speculative risk.
