/*

What is the purpose of getDerivedStateFromProps() lifecycle method?
    The new static getDerivedStateFromProps() lifecycle method is invoked after a component is instantiated as well as before it is re-rendered. It can return an object to update state, or null to indicate that the new props do not require any state updates.

    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    This lifecycle method along with componentDidUpdate() covers all the use cases of componentWillReceiveProps()
