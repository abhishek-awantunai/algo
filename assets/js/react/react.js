What are the advantages of React?
Below are the list of main advantages of React,

Increases the application's performance with Virtual DOM.
JSX makes code easy to read and write.
It renders both on client and server side (SSR).
Easy to integrate with frameworks (Angular, Backbone) since it is only a view library.
Easy to write unit and integration tests with tools such as Jest.


What are the limitations of React?
Apart from the advantages, there are few limitations of React too,

React is just a view library, not a full framework.
There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development.
Integrating React into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration.
The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX.
Too many smaller components leading to over engineering or boilerplate.
