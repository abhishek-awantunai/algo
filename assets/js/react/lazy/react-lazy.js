What is React lazy function?
    The React.lazy function lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. It will automatically load the bundle containing the OtherComponent when the component gets rendered. This must return a Promise which resolves to a module with a default export containing a React component.
    const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));

    function MyComponent() {
        return (
            <div>
                <OtherComponent />
            </div>
        );
    }
    Note: React.lazy and Suspense is not yet available for server-side rendering. If you want to do code-splitting in a server rendered app, we still recommend React Loadable.
