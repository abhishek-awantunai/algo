/*

React Context / Redux is a state management system for cross-component  and app wide state
Both avoids us to use props chain or props drilling

React Context API
    - Complex Setup / management
        - In more complex apps managing React Context can lead to a deeply nested JSX code and / or huge "Context Provider" components.
    - Performance wise its not so optimized for high frequency state changes. 

Redux
    - Simpler setup
    - Better than Context API
