Can I use web components in react application?
    Yes, you can use web components in a react application. Even though many developers won't use this combination, it may require especially if you are using third-party UI components that are written using Web Components.

    For example, let us use Vaadin date picker web component as below,

    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import './App.css';
    import '@vaadin/vaadin-date-picker';
    class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
        <div className="App">
            <vaadin-date-picker label="When were you born?"></vaadin-date-picker>
        </div>
        );
    }
    }
    export default App;
