Let's see the difference between React and Angular in a table format.

React	
React is a library and has only the View layer	
React handles rendering on the server side	
React uses JSX that looks like HTML in JS which can be confusing	
React Native, which is a React type to build mobile applications are faster and more stable	Ionic, 
In React, data flows only in one way and hence debugging is easy	

Angular
Angular is a framework and has complete MVC functionality
AngularJS renders only on the client side but Angular 2 and above renders on the server side
Angular follows the template approach for HTML, which makes code shorter and easy to understand
Angular's mobile native app is relatively less stable and slower
In Angular, data flows both way i.e it has two-way data binding between children and parent and hence debugging is often difficult

Note: The above list of differences are purely opinionated and it vary based on the professional experience. But they are helpful as base parameters
