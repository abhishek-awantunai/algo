How JSX prevents Injection Attacks?
    React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered.

    For example, you can embed user input as below,

    const name = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
    const element = <h1>{name}</h1>;
    This way you can prevent XSS(Cross-site-scripting) attacks in the application.
