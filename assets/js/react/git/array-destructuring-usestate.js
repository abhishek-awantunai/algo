Why do we use array destructuring (square brackets notation) in useState?
    When we declare a state variable with useState, it returns a pair â€” an array with two items. The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that updates the value. Using [0] and [1] to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meaning. This is why we use array destructuring instead.

    For example, the array index access would look as follows:

    var userStateVariable = useState('userProfile'); // Returns an array pair
    var user = userStateVariable[0]; // Access first item
    var setUser = userStateVariable[1]; // Access second item
    Whereas with array destructuring the variables can be accessed as follows:

    const [user, setUser] = useState('userProfile');
