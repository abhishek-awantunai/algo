/*

How you implement Server Side Rendering or SSR?
    React is already equipped to handle rendering on Node servers. A special version of the DOM renderer is available, which follows the same pattern as on the client side.

    import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server'
    import App from './App'

    ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />)
    This method will output the regular HTML as a string, which can be then placed inside a page body as part of the server response. On the client side, React detects the pre-rendered content and seamlessly picks up where it left off.
