What is React memo function?
Class components can be restricted from re-rendering when their input props are the same using PureComponent or shouldComponentUpdate. Now you can do the same with function components by wrapping them in React.memo.

const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
    only rerenders if props change 
});
