What is the difference between useState and useRef hook?
    useState causes components to re-render after state updates whereas useRef doesn’t cause a component to re-render when the value or state changes. Essentially, useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value in its (.current) property.
    useState allows us to update the state inside components. While useRef allows refrencing DOM elements.
