What is a switching component?
    A switching component is a component that renders one of many components. We need to use object to map prop values to components.

    For example, a switching component to display different pages based on page prop:

    import HomePage from './HomePage'
    import AboutPage from './AboutPage'
    import ServicesPage from './ServicesPage'
    import ContactPage from './ContactPage'

    const PAGES = {
        home: HomePage,
        about: AboutPage,
        services: ServicesPage,
        contact: ContactPage
    }

    const Page = (props) => {
        const Handler = PAGES[props.page] || ContactPage
        return <Handler {...props} />
    }

    // The keys of the PAGES object can be used in the prop types to catch dev-time errors.
    Page.propTypes = {
        page: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(PAGES)).isRequired
    }
