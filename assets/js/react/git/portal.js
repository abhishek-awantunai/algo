What are portals in React?
    - Portal is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

    ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)
    The first argument is any render-able React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument is a DOM element.
