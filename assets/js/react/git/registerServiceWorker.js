What is the purpose of registerServiceWorker in React?
    React creates a service worker for you without any configuration by default. The service worker is a web API that helps you cache your assets and other files so that when the user is offline or on a slow network, he/she can still see results on the screen, as such, it helps you build a better user experience, that's what you should know about service worker for now. It's all about adding offline capabilities to your site.

    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import App from './App';
    import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
    registerServiceWorker();
