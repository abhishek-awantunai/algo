What is a consumer?
    A Consumer is a React component that subscribes to context changes. It requires a function as a child which receives current context value as argument and returns a react node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree.

    Lets take a simple example,

    <MyContext.Consumer>
    {value => render something based on the context value }
    </MyContext.Consumer>
