How to write comments in React?
    The comments in React/JSX are similar to JavaScript Multiline comments but are wrapped in curly braces.

    Single-line comments:

    <div>
        {/* Single-line comments(In vanilla JavaScript, the single-line comments are represented by double slash(//)) */ /*}
        {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
    </div>
    
    
    Multi-line comments:

    <div>
        {/* Multi-line comments for more than
        one line */ /*}
        {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
    </div>
