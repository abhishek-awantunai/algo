How events are different in React?
    Handling events in React elements has some syntactic differences:

    React event handlers are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
    With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

How do you pass an event handler to a component?
    You can pass event handlers and other functions as props to child components. It can be used in child component as below,

    <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
