/*

Why React uses className over class attribute?
    class is a keyword in JavaScript, and JSX is an extension of JavaScript. That's the principal reason why React uses className instead of class. Pass a string as the className prop.

    render() {
    return <span className={'menu navigation-menu'}>{'Menu'}</span>
    }
