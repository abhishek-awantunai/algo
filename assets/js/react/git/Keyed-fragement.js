What are Keyed Fragments?
    The Fragments declared with the explicit <React.Fragment> syntax may have keys. The general use case is mapping a collection to an array of fragments as below,

    function Glossary(props) {
    return (
        <dl>
        {props.items.map(item => (
            // Without the `key`, React will fire a key warning
            <React.Fragment key={item.id}>
            <dt>{item.term}</dt>
            <dd>{item.description}</dd>
            </React.Fragment>
        ))}
        </dl>
    );
    }
Note: key is the only attribute that can be passed to Fragment. In the future, there might be a support for additional attributes, such as event handlers.
