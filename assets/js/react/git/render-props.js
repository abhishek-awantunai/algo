What are render props?
    Render Props is a simple technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function. The below component uses render prop which returns a React element.

    <DataProvider render={data => (
        <h1>{`Hello ${data.target}`}</h1>
    )}/>
    Libraries such as React Router and DownShift are using this pattern
