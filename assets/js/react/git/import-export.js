How to import and export components using React and ES6?
    You should use default for exporting the components

    import React from 'react'
    import User from 'user'

    export default class MyProfile extends React.Component {
        render(){
            return (
            <User type="customer">
                //...
            </User>
            )
        }
    }
    With the export specifier, the MyProfile is going to be the member and exported to this module and the same can be imported without mentioning the name in other components.
