/*

Can you force a component to re-render without calling setState?
    By default, when your component's state or props change, your component will re-render. If your render() method depends on some other data, you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling forceUpdate().

    component.forceUpdate(callback)

    It is recommended to avoid all uses of forceUpdate() and only read from this.props and this.state in render().
