/*

What is the purpose of render method of react-dom?
    - This method is used to render a React element into the DOM in the supplied container and return a reference to the component. If the React element was previously rendered into container, it will perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest changes.

    ReactDOM.render(element, container, callback?)
    If the optional callback is provided, it will be executed after the component is rendered or updated.
