What is JSX?

    - JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.

    - Web browsers cannot read JSX directly. This is because they are built to only read regular JS objects and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object 
    
    - For a web browser to read a JSX file, the file needs to be transformed into a regular JavaScript object. For this, we use Babel

Who converts JSX to JavaScript?
    - The transpiler the BABEL.

Can we create a react application without JSX?
    - Yes
