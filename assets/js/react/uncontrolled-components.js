What are uncontrolled components?

    The Uncontrolled Components are the ones that store their own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.

    In the below UserProfile component, the name input is accessed using ref.

    class UserProfile extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this)
        this.input = React.createRef()
    }

    handleSubmit(event) {
        alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.input.current.value)
        event.preventDefault()
    }

    render() {
        return (
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <label>
            {'Name:'}
            <input type="text" ref={this.input} />
            </label>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
        </form>
        );
    }
    }
    In most cases, it's recommend to use controlled components to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.
