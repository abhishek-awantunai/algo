/*

What are the drawbacks of MVW pattern?
    - DOM manipulation is very expensive which causes applications to behave slow and inefficient.
    - Due to circular dependencies, a complicated model was created around models and views.
    - Lot of data changes happens for collaborative applications(like Google Docs).
    - No way to do undo (travel back in time) easily without adding so much extra code.
