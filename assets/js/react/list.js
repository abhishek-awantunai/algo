/* 

- Keys are very important in lists for the following reasons:

    - A key is a unique identifier and it is used to identify which items have changed, been updated or deleted from the lists.It also helps to determine which components need to be re-rendered instead of re-rendering all the components every time. Therefore, it increases performance, as only the updated components are re-rendered
