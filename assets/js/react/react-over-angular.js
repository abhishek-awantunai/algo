Why React over Angular?
    -  Easy creation of dynamic applications: 
        - React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because it provides less coding and provides more functionality, whereas, with JavaScript applications, code tends to get complex very quickly.

    - Improved performance: 
        - React uses virtual DOM, which makes web applications perform faster. Virtual DOM compares its previous state and updates only those components in the real DOM, whose states have changed, rather than updating all the components â€” like conventional web applications.

    - Reusable components: 
        - Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. These components have their own logic and controls, and they can be reused through the application, which, in turn, dramatically reduces the development time of an application

    - Unidirectional data flow: 
        - React follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that when designing a React app, we often nest child components within parent components. And since the data flows in a single direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and know where the problem occurs in an application at the moment.

    - Dedicated tools for easy debugging: 
        - Facebook has released a chrome extension that we can use to debug React applications. This makes the process of debugging React to web applications faster and easier
