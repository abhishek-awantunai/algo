Difference between a class and functional component.

    Class Components

        Class-based Components uses ES6 class syntax. It can make use of the lifecycle methods.
        Class components extend from React.Component.
        In here you have to use this keyword to access the props and functions that you declare inside the class components.

    Functional Components

        Functional Components are simpler comparing to class-based functions.
        Functional Components mainly focuses on the UI of the application, not on the behavior.
        To be more precise these are basically render function in the class component.
        Functional Components can have state and mimic lifecycle events using Reach Hooks
