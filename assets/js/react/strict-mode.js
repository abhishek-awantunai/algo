/*

When would you use StrictMode component in React?
    - I've found it especially useful to implement strict mode when I'm working on new code bases and I want to see what kind of code/components I'm facing. Also if you're on bug hunting mode, sometimes it's a good idea to wrap with <StrictMode /> the components/blocks of code you think might be the source of the problem.
