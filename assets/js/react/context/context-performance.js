How do you solve performance corner cases while using context?
    The context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a providerâ€™s parent re-renders.

    For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value.

    class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
        <Provider value={{something: 'something'}}>
            <Toolbar />
        </Provider>
        );
    }
    }
    This can be solved by lifting up the value to parent state,

    class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
        value: {something: 'something'},
        };
    }

    render() {
        return (
        <Provider value={this.state.value}>
            <Toolbar />
        </Provider>
        );
    }
    }
