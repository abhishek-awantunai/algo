HUSKY :-
    Using this we can avoid bad commits as during commit only it will fix bad identation or any such errors.

Git Hooks :-
    we can use them to do certain things we can add some taskes to do pre commit or post commit

Mudule Bundlers :-
    Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, 
    Snowpack :- good one can be the future it is fast as instead of recompiling on every change it builds all your dependencies once and then ships them directly to the browser. So changes are reflected instatntly as it does not have to go over the dependency tree.
