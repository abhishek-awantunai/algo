/**
  Unlike the previous versions of Angular, the 7th major release comes with splitting in @angular/core. This is done in order to reduce the size of the same. Typically, not each and every module is required by an Angular developer. Therefore, in Angular 7 each split of the @angular/core will have no more than 418 modules.

  Also, Angular 7 brings drag - and - drop and virtual scrolling into play.The latter enables loading as well as unloading elements from the DOM.For virtual scrolling, the latest version of Angular comes with the package.Furthermore, Angular 7 comes with a new and enhanced version of the ng - compiler.
