/*
  Dependency injection is an application design pattern that is implemented by Angular and forms the core concepts of Angular.

  Let us understand in a detailed manner. Dependencies in Angular are services which have a functionality. Various components and directives in an application can need these functionalities of the service. Angular provides a smooth mechanism by which these dependencies are injected into components and directives.

  Typically, dependencies required by a component are services. A componentâ€™s constructor parameters tell Angular about the services that a component requires. So, a dependency injection offers a way to supply fully-formed dependencies required by a new instance of a class.
