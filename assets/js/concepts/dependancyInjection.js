/*
  Dependency injection is an application design pattern that is implemented by Angular and forms the core concepts of Angular.

  Let us understand in a detailed manner. Dependencies in Angular are services which have a functionality. Various components and directives in an application can need these functionalities of the service. Angular provides a smooth mechanism by which these dependencies are injected into components and directives.
