/**

  v7 :
  - Unlike the previous versions of Angular, the 7th major release comes with splitting in @angular/core. This is done in order to reduce the size of the same. Typically, not each and every module is required by an Angular developer. Therefore, in Angular 7 each split of the @angular/core will have no more than 418 modules.

  - Also, Angular 7 brings drag - and - drop and virtual scrolling into play.The latter enable loading as well as unloading elements from the DOM.For virtual scrolling, the latest version of Angular comes with the package.Furthermore, Angular 7 comes with a new and enhanced version of the ng - compiler.

  V8 :
    - Differential Loading:
      - a Differential loading is a process by which the browser chooses between modern or legacy JavaScript based on its own capabilities
    - New lazy loading syntax
      - in place of the proprietary syntax to enable lazy loading, the framework has adopted the more common dynamic import syntax used widely in client-side web development
  V9 -
    - Ivy is enabled by default
      - Ivy is the code name for Angular's next-generation compilation and rendering pipeline. With the version 9 release of Angular, the new compiler and runtime instructions are used by default instead of the older compiler and runtime, known as View Engine.
