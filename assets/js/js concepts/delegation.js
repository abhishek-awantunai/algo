/**

Event Delegation :-
    - It is technique of handling events in a better way.It exists because of event bubbling.
    Instead of attaching event handlers to each li attach a event handler on UL and get the target from event.target.

    <ul>
        <li>Camera</li>
        <li>Shoe</li>
        <li>Laptop</li>
        <li>Mobile</li>
    </ul>
