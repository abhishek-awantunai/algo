/*

Template Engine -> View Engine -> Ivy Engine

In view engine we do have Single Template Interpreter at runtime but in Ivy we do have broken that single template interpreter into several individual set of rendering functions / instructions.
It is almost like assembly language of angular templates  

Ivy is the code name for Angular's next-generation compilation and rendering pipeline. With the version 9 release of Angular, the new compiler and runtime instructions are used by default instead of the older compiler and runtime, known as View Engine.
