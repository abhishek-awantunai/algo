/**

What is ng-content and its purpose?

    - The ng-content is used to insert the content dynamically inside the component that helps to increase component reusability.

    Content projection is a pattern in which you insert, or project, the content you want to use inside another component.

    - We can use ng-content to project content directly inside the component to increase its reusability.
