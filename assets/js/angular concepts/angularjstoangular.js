/**

Migration from Angular JS to Angular


Way 1)
    - Rewrite the whole application

Way 2)
    - We can use ngma ( Ng Migration Assistant ) 
    - If we run ngma in our project then we get whole list of things that needs to be done which may consist of
    - Like refactoring $rootScope into services 
    - Converting javascript files into typescript files
    - converting angular-js controllers into angular components
    - converting ng-src to [src] and other syntax
