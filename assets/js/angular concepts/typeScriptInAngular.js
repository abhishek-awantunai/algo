/**

  Why prioritize TypeScript over JavaScript in Angular?

  TypeScript is a superset of Javascript as it is Javascript + Types or extra features like typecasting for variables, annotations, variable scope and much more. Typescript is designed in a way to overcome Javascript shortcomings like typecasting of variables, classes, decorators, variable scope and many more. Moreover, Typescript is purely object-oriented programming that offers a "Compiler" that can convert to Javascript-equivalent code.
