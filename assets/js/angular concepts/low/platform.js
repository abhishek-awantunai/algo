/*

A platform is the context in which an Angular application runs. The most common platform for Angular applications is a web browser, but it can also be an operating system for a mobile device, or a web server. The runtime-platform is provided by the @angular/platform-* packages and these packages allow applications that make use of @angular/core and @angular/common to execute in different environments. i.e, Angular can be used as platform-independent framework in different environments, For example,

While running in the browser, it uses platform-browser package.
When SSR(server-side rendering ) is used, it uses platform-server package for providing web server implementation.
