Interface :-
    - An interface is an abstract type that tells the compiler which property names a given object can have.
    We can use interface to design the shape of objects or classes or functions
    We can extend the interface
    Merge two interfaces


The typescript type supports only the data types and not the use of an object. The typescript interface supports the use of the object.
We can use | in Type but not with interface
