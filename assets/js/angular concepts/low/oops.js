/**
  Four pillars of Object Oriented Programming

  i) Encapsulation
  - In Object Oriented programming we group related variables and functions that operate on them into objects.
  ii) Abstraction
  - In objects we hide some of the methods and properties from the outside and this gives us a couple of benefits.
    a) We make interface of that object simpler i.e only few properties and methods need to be known for the working of the object.
    b) It helps us reduce the impact of change i.e if some later day of we change this inner or outer private methods then none of these changes will leak to the outside world.
  iii) Inheritance
  - It is a mechanism that allows us to eliminate redundant code
  iv) Polymorphism
  - It is a technique that allows us to get rid of long Switch and if else cases.



  Benefits of OOPS

  i) Encapsulation - Reduce Complexity + Increase Reusability
  ii) Abstraction - Reduce Complexity + Isolate Impact of change
  iii) Inheritance - Eliminate Redundant Code
  iv) Polymorphism - Refactor Ugly switch / case statements
