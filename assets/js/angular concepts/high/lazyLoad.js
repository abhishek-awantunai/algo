/*

  By lazy-loading a module we can tell Angular to load it only when its route is been visited, meaning that its weight wonâ€™t affect the size of your application at startup.
  
  Lazy loading is one of the most useful concepts of Angular Routing. It helps us to download the web pages in chunks instead of downloading everything in a big bundle.
