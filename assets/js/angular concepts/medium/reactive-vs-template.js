What are the differences between reactive forms and template driven forms?


Template driven forms are model-driven forms where you write the logic, validations, controls etc, in the template part of the code using directives.


Reactive forms is a model-driven approach for creating forms in a reactive style(form inputs changes over time). These are built around observable streams, where form inputs and values are provided as streams of input values
